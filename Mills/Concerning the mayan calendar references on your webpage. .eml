Hello Dr. Mills,

I found your web site while reading about UTC. I noticed that there is =
an on going issue with leap year and leap second corrections in global =
time keeping. I also noticed that you have an interest in the Mayan =
calendar and wanted to share some quick information with you. I=E2=80=99ve=
 included a link to an .svg image file that illustrates the structure of =
the Tzolkin calendar. While it isn=E2=80=99t to scale, the image =
illustrates the =E2=80=9Cnested cycle=E2=80=9D structure of the Tzolkin =
Calendar. While the structure may seem uninteresting. I think that it =
offers a solution to the leap year / leap second issue. If you look at =
the 7 day 6 night structure you may notice that the cycles go from 1st =
day to 7th day=E2=80=A6then back to a 1st day! What is not widely known =
is that the Mayans were capable of scaling this structure into very =
small intervals of time. Basically they were able to use the same =
structure for very large time keeping and very small time keeping. The =
reason this is such an important concept is that this structures allows =
for an infinite division of time in such a way that it fits perfectly =
into a macro scale of time keeping. Basically they sliced time up with a =
fractal structure so that the micro and macro levels are self similar. I =
plan to develop this concept further because I believe that it will be =
come immensely important as a means to time keeping that isn=E2=80=99t =
tethered to the movement of the Earth (Heliocentric or Geocentric). If =
you are a science fiction fan you may know may be familiar with the term =
=E2=80=9Cstar date=E2=80=9D. I believe that man kind needs to =
desperately develop a method if time keeping that doesn=E2=80=99t =
reference the movement of the Earth. I believe that this idea will allow =
us to develop this method.=20
